The second game I made: SLIMEMON

Turn Base is a 2D game, a simple game where we increase the power of our slime by killing enemies,

CONTROLS:
To switch between options: right, left bottom, up arrow keys,

To confirm: Space

note: the game must be in the same directory as the images folder

installation: on the cmd screen respectively;
pip install python

If you have installed it before, you do not need to reinstall it.
